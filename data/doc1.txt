Deep learning has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past decade, driven by breakthroughs in model architecture and computational resources. Early neural networks were shallow and limited in expressive power, but the introduction of deeper architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet enabled large-scale visual recognition with unprecedented accuracy. Skip connections and residual blocks greatly reduced issues like vanishing gradients, allowing networks to grow to hundreds of layers. More recently, transformer-based models have replaced convolutional networks in many domains, offering superior scalability and sequence modeling capabilities. These architectures rely on self-attention mechanisms, which allow models to weigh relationships between tokens across long distances, making them ideal for natural language processing, speech understanding, and even image generation. The efficiency of these models has improved with innovations like sparse attention, quantization, and model distillation. As a result, even smaller devices can now run high-performing AI systems. Continued advancements in neural architecture search and automated optimization techniques are enabling the development of architectures that adapt to specific tasks without heavy manual tuning. The evolution of deep learning architecture continues to redefine what AI systems can achieve in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalization.
