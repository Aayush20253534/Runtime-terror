Autonomous robotics has rapidly advanced due to the integration of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to perceive, plan, and act with minimal human intervention. Modern robots rely on computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning to interpret their environments in real time. These capabilities allow robots to navigate complex terrains, manipulate objects with precision, and operate safely around humans. Reinforcement learning has been particularly influential, allowing robots to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error. This approach has led to breakthroughs in locomotion, with robots mastering dynamic activities such as running, jumping, and balancing on uneven surfaces. Meanwhile, large-scale simulation environments enable millions of virtual training episodes to accelerate robotic learning before deployment in the real world. AI also enhances robotic swarm systems, where multiple agents collaborate to perform tasks such as search and rescue, warehouse automation, and environmental monitoring. Despite these achievements, challenges persist in generalization, energy consumption, and safe decision-making. As AI models become more adaptable and sample-efficient, autonomous robotics will continue evolving toward flexible, human-centric applications, including elder care, industrial automation, and disaster response.
